# DaviScout
DaviScout is a restaurant sharing app. Although immature, this project helped me see the whole lifecycle of building a full-stack web application.
Specifically, this app includes

- A web app with CRUD functionality
- Express JS for routing, MongoDB for database management
- NodeJS to write server-side JavaScript
- Responsive pages using Bootstrap
- Basic authorization and authentication using Passport

## Deployment

- Deployed using Netlify

## Getting Started

- Go to the restaurants page in order to see the restaurants
- Register and Login in order to be able to leave a review
- In order for the map to correctly display the location in Davis, you must add a location that is in Davis, without a zip code or state. Any other location will give a weird location, as the API logic is set to append Davis, CA 95616 to the end of the address
